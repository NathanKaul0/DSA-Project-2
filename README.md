# Ride-Sharing Demand Zones: K-Means vs DBSCAN Clustering

 ~~Note: to run the Streamlit app, you must ensure that the terminal's working directory is the folder containing the source files.  
 To do this, run `cd "[your file path]/DSA-Project-2/PycharmProjects/Project 2 DSA"`.  
 Then, run `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.  
 If you don't do this, the program will fail to find the various data files required to run, and you will see errors.~~  

To run the algorithms, simply run each file in an IDE or terminal.  
In order to function, the unzipped `taxi_zones` folder with the data files **must** be in your working directory.  
If you must change it, run the command `cd "[your file path]/DSA-Project-2/PycharmProjects/Project 2 DSA"` in your terminal.
