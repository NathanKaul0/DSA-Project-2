# Ride-Sharing Demand Zones: K-Means vs DBSCAN Clustering

To run the algorithms, simply run each file in an IDE or terminal.  
In order to function, the unzipped `taxi_zones` folder with the data files **must** be in your working directory.  
If you must change it, run the command `cd "[your file path]/DSA-Project-2/PycharmProjects/Project 2 DSA"` in your terminal.

Similarly, to run the Streamlit app, you must ensure that the terminal's working directory is the folder containing the source files (run the above command).  
Then, run the app from a terminal. By default, the command should be `streamlit run ../../streamlit.py`, or `python -m streamlit run ../../streamlit.py` (either version works).
If you don't do this, the program will fail to find the various data files required to run, and you will see errors.
